# Maze

A cool little maze game I made

The maze generator is a randomized traversal method where nodes are only added and subsequently explored if they have 2 or less open neighbors.
This allows for the maze to be mazey for the most part, but occasionally loop back on itself, which makes it kinda more fun in my opinion.

It should also work on mobile, with the keys
