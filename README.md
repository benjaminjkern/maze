# Maze

A cool little maze game I made.

The maze generator is a randomized traversal method where nodes are only added and subsequently explored if they have 2 or less open neighbors.
This allows for the maze to be mazey for the most part, but occasionally loop back on itself, which makes it kinda more fun in my opinion.

You can't go back to a space you've been before, and restarting you sets you back to the 2x2 maze.
Try to see how far you can get without getting stuck! My record is 75x75 so far.
Eventually I might make a leaderboard so you can compare your progress with other's.

It should also work on mobile, with buttons that show up if your screen is the right size
