# [Maze (Click here to play)](https://benjaminjkern.github.io/maze)

A cool little maze game I made.

The maze generator is a randomized traversal method where nodes are only added and subsequently explored if they have 2 or less open neighbors.
This allows for the maze to be mazey for the most part, but occasionally loop back on itself, which makes it kinda more fun in my opinion.

There are also enemies that try to eat you. (Ouch!)

The newest version has a fog, so you can only see a portion of the maze at a time.
If you die, you restart the maze (But it is the same maze).
If you make it to the goal, you get to play a bigger maze!

Eventually I might make a leaderboard so you can compare your progress with other's.

~~It should also work on mobile, with buttons that show up if your screen is the right size~~ (I removed this for the time being but it used to be a thing)
